Projects and Challengs


TO DO:

JACOBI AND GAUSS SEIDEL (Same File), will be implemented in the ongoing Matrix project

The Transversal Problem, is a group math investigation if the zero game is deterministic. Right now only the interface od the game is completed but with help of the mini-max algorithm more data will be gathered to suport the math proofs being written (litle spoiler, we suposed that is deterministic, being a draw for n>= 2

IPB Final Project is a project that gathered 17.5 final grade, wich essentialy revolves around a secret spy agency with diferent agents, documments and clearence levels.




The 3 ongoing projects revolve around three areas:

Matrix - Data Manipulation and Storage

Transversal Problem - Machine Learning (min-max)

K-Means - Sorting Data
